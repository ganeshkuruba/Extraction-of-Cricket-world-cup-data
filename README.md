# Extraction-of-Cricket-world-cup-data
I have used java script and node.js to complete this project.
The code will download the cricket data from web and the data is seperated with respect to the cricket teams and for easy access the data is stored separately with respect to the teams in the form of .CSV and .PDF files.
I have used different libraries to download and process the data.
